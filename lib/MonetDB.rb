# A typical sequence of events is as follows:
# Fire a query using the database handle to send the statement to the server and get back a result set object.

# A result set object  has methods for fetching rows, moving around in the result set, obtaining column metadata, and releasing the result set.
# Use a row fetching method such as 'fetch_row' or an iterator such as each to access the rows of the result set.
# Call 'free' to release the result set.

    # = Introduction
    #
    # A typical sequence of events is as follows:
    # Create a database instance (handle), invoke query using the database handle to send the statement to the server and get back a result set object.
    #
    # A result set object  has methods for fetching rows, moving around in the result set, obtaining column metadata, and releasing the result set.
    # A result set object is an instance of the MonetDBData class.
    #
    # Records can be returneds as arrays and iterators over the set.
    #
    # A database handler (dbh) is and instance of the MonetDB class.
    #
    # = Connection management 
    #
    #  connect    -  establish a new connection
    #                * user: username (default is monetdb)
    #                * passwd: password (default is monetdb)
    #                * lang: language (default is sql) 
    #                * host: server hostanme or ip  (default is localhost)
    #                * port: server port (default is 50000)
    #                * db_name: name of the database to connect to
    #                * auth_type: hashing function to use during authentication (default is SHA1)
    #
    #  is_connected? - returns true if there is an active connection to a server, false otherwise 
    #  reconnect     - recconnect to a server
    #  close         - terminate a connection
    #  auto_commit?  - returns ture if the session is running in auto commit mode, false otherwise  
    #  auto_commit   - enable/disable auto commit mode.
    #
    #  query         - fire a query
    #
    # Currently MAPI protocols 8 and 9 are supported.
    #
    # = Managing record sets 
    #
    #
    # A record set is represented as an instance of the MonetDBData class; the class provides methods to manage retrieved data.
    #
    #
    # The following methods allow to iterate over data:
    # 
    # fetch          - iterates over the record set and retrieves on row at a time. Each row is returned as an array.
    # fetch_hash     - iterates over columns (on cell at a time). 
    # fetch_all_hash - returns record set entries hashed by column name orderd by column position.
    # 
    # To return the record set as an array (with each tuple stored as array of fields) the following method can be used:
    # 
    # fetch_all      - fetch all rows and store them  
    #
    #
    # Information about the retrieved record set can be obtained via the following methods:
    #
    # num_rows       - returns the number of rows present in the record set
    # num_fields     - returns the number of fields (columns) that compose the schema
    # name_fields    - returns the (ordered) name of the schema's columns
    # type_fields    - returns the (ordered) types list of the schema's columns
    #
    # To release a record set MonetDBData#free can be used.
    #
    # = Type conversion
    #
    # A mapping between SQL and ruby type is supported. Each retrieved field can be converted to a ruby datatype via 
    # a getTYPE method.
    #
    # The currently supported cast methods are:
    #
    # getInt        - convert to an integer value
    # getFloat      - convert to a floating point value
    # getString     - return a string representation of the value, with trailing and leading " characters removed
    # getBlob       - convert an SQL stored HEX string to its binary representation
    # getTime       - return a string representation of a TIME field
    # getDate       - return a string representation of a DATE field
    # getDateTime   - convert a TIMESTAMP field to a ruby Time object
    # getChar       - on ruby >= 1.9, convert a CHAR field to char 
    # getBool       - convert a BOOLEAN field to a ruby bool object. If the value of the field is unknown, nil is returned
    # getNull       - convert a NULL value to a nil object
    #
    #
    # = Transactions 
    #
    # By default monetdb works in auto_commit mode. To turn this feature off MonetDB#auto_commit(flag=false) can be used.
    #
    # Once auto_commit has been disable it is possible to start transactions, create/delete savepoints, rollback and commit with 
    # the usual SQL statements.
    #
    # Savepoints IDs can be generated using the MonetDB#save method. To release a savepoint ID use MonetDB#release.
    # 
    # Savepoints can be accessed (as a stack) with the MonetDB#transactions method.
    #
    # example/standalone.rb contains usage example of the above mentioned methods.
